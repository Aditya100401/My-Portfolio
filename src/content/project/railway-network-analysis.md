title: "Analysis of South Indian Railway Networks"
description: "
              A deep dive into an exciting research project as a part-time researcher at IIT Madras, built a simulation of the South Indian railway network.
              Scraped track lengths, station data, and train timetables from railway websites, cleaned and structured the data while standardizing key terminologies.
              Developed a database pipeline linking station routes and modeled real-world train operations using SimPy.
              The simulation incorporated parameters like cruise speed and signaling protocols, running actual timetables on the network and generating detailed activity logs for further analysis."
